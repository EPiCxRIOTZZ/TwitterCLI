# TwitterCLI

# First step
Works only on 15" devices, like the macbook pro right now. will fix it tomorrow.
to get this to work, replace your keys with your keys from apps.twitter.com

`twitter = Twitter(auth = OAuth(config.access_key,
                  config.access_secret,
                  config.consumer_key,
                  config.consumer_secret))` 
                  
# second first step

start the Installer by running `./SetupRequirements` and selecting option 1. if you mess up your files, or i tell you on twitter, run option 2, which updates the whole TwitterCLI system with the newest aviable.
