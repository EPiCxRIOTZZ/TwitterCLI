# First step
Works only on 15" devices, like the macbook pro right now. will fix it tomorrow.
To get this to work, please run `./SetupRequirements` and option 1 first. when thats done, run `./SetupRequirements`again and run option 3 to insert your access tokens. easy, isnt it?
                  
# second first step

start the Installer by running `./SetupRequirements` and selecting option 1. if you mess up your files, or i tell you on twitter, run option 2, which updates the whole TwitterCLI system with the newest aviable.

All credits go to me, iSn0w.
