# TwitterCLI
Works only on 15" devices, like the macbook pro right now. will fix it tomorrow.
to get this to work, replace your keys with your keys from apps.twitter.com

`twitter = Twitter(auth = OAuth(config.access_key,
                  config.access_secret,
                  config.consumer_key,
                  config.consumer_secret))`
